# Mini Video Player App

A small example of a video player implementation in React. Uses JSON to configure text and stream url. Redux for state management of the JSON data and hooks for management of the player state. Redux is only used to demonstrate aptitude in it's use as the data state could have been handled using hooks in an app of this size.
